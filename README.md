# pyray3d
An implementation of a 3D raytracer in python.

This is a reaserch project to implement a raytracer. 

**Time to render below scene -  `57` sec.** pretty decent as there is no optmizations attempted in this python code. Once I am happy with features, i will optmize the code & pretty sure this can be brought down by using `numpy` & doing the heav lifting in `Cython`.
